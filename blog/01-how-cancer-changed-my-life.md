For two years, I worked as a software engineer at a private company. My work hours were the usual 9-to-5, and my salary was more than enough for my needs. It felt like a steady and reliable job, the kind of job that many people aim for. But everything changed in June 2024 when I found out I had a lump in my neck and turns out it is a fucking cancer. Something that I have never imagined beforeâ€”a healthy, young person like me, who has never smoked or consumed alcohol, being diagnosed with this shit. This news turned my world upside down and made me rethink my career and what I really wanted out of life.

When I got my diagnosis, everything started to feel harder. It wasnâ€™t just the emotional stress; my body also felt very weak. I couldnâ€™t keep up with the demands of a 9-to-5 job. I felt so tired all the time, and just the idea of going back to work felt overwhelming. I realized that my health had to come first.

Leaving my job was a really tough choice, but it was something I needed to do. Quitting meant giving up a stable income and leaving behind my coworkers, who had become my friends. But I knew it was the right thing for me. After I quit, I started helping my parents with their daily tasks. It made me feel good to help them and feel useful at home. This was something I hadnâ€™t experienced before in the same way, and it gave me a new sense of purpose.

At the same time, I found out I really liked making content on Instagram and TikTok. I started sharing fun moments, ideas, and stories. Making videos helped me express myself and connect with other people. It also made me feel like I was still doing something meaningful, even though I wasnâ€™t working a traditional job. It was exciting to see how others enjoyed my content, and it gave me a sense of accomplishment.

This change in my lifestyle also helped me find something I had been missing: work-life balance. I didnâ€™t have to follow a strict schedule anymore, and I could plan my days in a way that suited me better. I could sleep in, spend time on things I enjoyed, and focus on staying healthy. This freedom gave me time to think about what I really wanted in life. I realized that I needed to find work that wasnâ€™t too demanding but could still support me financially. This would let me keep living a balanced life that made me happy and healthy.

As I settled into this new way of living, I picked up hobbies that have brought me a lot of joy. I started doing parkour and going to the gym. These activities have helped me feel stronger and stay active. Parkour, especially, has taught me how to adapt and keep going even when things are hard. Itâ€™s also a lot of fun! Going to the gym has been a way for me to challenge myself and feel proud of what I can do. These hobbies keep me motivated and help me feel good about myself.

Iâ€™ve also started making new friends and connections. Iâ€™ve met other people who are also dealing with chronic illnesses, and weâ€™ve formed a supportive community. It feels great to have friends who understand what Iâ€™m going through because theyâ€™ve been through it too. These friendships have given me strength and reminded me that Iâ€™m not alone in this journey.

At the same time, Iâ€™m spending time learning new things, especially in technology. Even though Iâ€™m not in an office job anymore, I still want to keep my skills sharp. Learning about new tech trends and tools has been really exciting. It makes me feel connected to my old career while also giving me ideas for the future. Maybe Iâ€™ll do freelance work or start my own projects. These learning experiences keep me inspired and ready for whatâ€™s next.

One part of my life that hasnâ€™t changed is my medical treatment. I still go to RSUP Sardjito in Yogyakarta for my treatments, which happen about one to four times a month. These visits remind me that Iâ€™m still on this journey, but they also show me how far Iâ€™ve come. The doctors and nurses there have been so supportive, making my treatments a little easier to face. Even though itâ€™s tough, I try to focus on the progress Iâ€™ve made and the strength Iâ€™ve gained.

Iâ€™m still figuring out what this new chapter of my life will look like. ðŸ˜Š Whether itâ€™s making videos, doing freelance work, or exploring other options, Iâ€™m focused on keeping a good balance between work and life. Leaving my office job was a big change, but I donâ€™t regret it. This journey is about finding work that fits my values, keeps me healthy, and lets me live the way I want. ðŸŒŸ Itâ€™s been a challenging road, but itâ€™s also been full of chances to grow, make new friends, and think about what success really means to me.
